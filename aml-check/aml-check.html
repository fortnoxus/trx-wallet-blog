            <h2>What is AML?</h2>
            <p>
                AML (Anti-Money Laundering) refers to a set of laws, regulations, and procedures aimed at preventing criminals from disguising illegally obtained funds as legitimate income. AML compliance is crucial for financial institutions, including cryptocurrency platforms.
