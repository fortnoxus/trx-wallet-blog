            <p>
                TRX, also known as Tron, is a cryptocurrency that powers the Tron blockchain. It was created to revolutionize the entertainment industry by decentralizing content distribution and enabling creators to connect directly with their audience.

            <h2>The Birth of Tron</h2>
            <p>
                Tron was founded in 2017 by <strong>Justin Sun</strong>, a prominent entrepreneur and tech visionary. Justin Sun, a protégé of Jack Ma (founder of Alibaba), envisioned a decentralized internet where content creators could share their work without intermediaries like YouTube, Netflix, or Spotify.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Tron Foundation, based in Singapore, launched the TRX token through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in September 2017, raising over $70 million. This marked the beginning of Tron's journey to disrupt the entertainment and content-sharing industries.
